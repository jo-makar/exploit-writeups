## tcp-echo-server

Simple TCP echo server with buffer overflow vulnerability (original source [here](https://github.com/polyverse/tcp-echo-server))

Involves defeating stack canaries by leaking stack values and bypassing non-executable stack (-z noexecstack) via ROP (Return Oriented Programming) gadget to prepare and invoke a system() call.

## crbug-941743

Chrome V8 type confusion [bug](https://crbug.com/941743), assigned CVE-2019-5825

The context for this exploit is a non-sandboxed renderer (otherwise a sandbox escape is also required) that executes user-specified Javascript.  The approach taken involves custom shellcode to support exfiltration using only syscalls and writing its output to user-visible buffer that is later rendered.
