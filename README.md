Simple TCP echo server with buffer overflow vulnerability (original source [here](https://github.com/polyverse/tcp-echo-server))

Involves defeating stack canaries by leaking stack values and bypassing non-executable stack (-z noexecstack) via ROP (Return Oriented Programming) gadget to prepare and invoke a system() call.
